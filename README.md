# Final Project: COGS 108 Data Science in Practice

The final project for COGS 108, Data Science in Practice, was a quarter-long project in collaboration with several other students. 

We began this project at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This project explores messages put out by various schools about COVID-19 using sentiment analysis.
